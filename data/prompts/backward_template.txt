You are a careful verifier. Given a problem and a candidate answer, verify whether the answer is correct by reasoning backwards from the answer.

Problem: {question}
Candidate Answer: {answer}

Verify the solution step by step. Check if:
1. The answer makes sense given the problem constraints
2. Working backwards from the answer leads to valid intermediate steps
3. The final answer matches what the problem asks for

Conclude with either:
- Verification: PASS (if the answer is correct)
- Verification: FAIL (if the answer is incorrect, explain why)
