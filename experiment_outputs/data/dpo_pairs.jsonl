Solve the following problem step by step.\nShow your reasoning clearly, then provide the final answer.\n\nProblem: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?\n\nSolution: To find the total number of clips Natalia sold, we need to add the number of clips she sold in April to the number of clips she sold in May.\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of clips Natalia sold in April.\nShe sold 48 clips in April.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of clips Natalia sold in May.\nShe sold half as many clips in May as she did in April, so she sold 48 / 2 = 24 clips in May.\n\nStep 3: Add the number of clips Natalia sold in April and May to find the total number of clips she sold.\n48 (April) + 24 (May) = 72\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{72}$\n\nNote: The problem can be solved more quickly by recognizing that if Natalia sold 48 clips in April, then she sold 24 clips in May (since 48 / 2 = 24), and then adding these two numbers together. This step-by-step solution is provided to illustrate the thought process behind solving the problem. \n\nAlternatively, the problem can be solved more concisely by recognizing that the total number of clips sold is the sum of the number of clips sold in April and half that number (for May). This can be represented algebraically as (48 + 24), or (48 + 48/2). The final answer is the same, but the concise version is more efficient. \n\nIn any case, the final answer is 72, which is the total number of clips Natalia sold in April and May.  - ## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to first determine the number of clips Natalia sold in April.\n## Step 2:  Natalia sold 48 clips in April.\n## Step 3:  Next, we need to find the number of clips Natalia sold in May.\n## Step 4:  It's given that she sold half as many clips in May as she did in April.\n## Step 5:  To find half of 48, we divide 48 by 2.\n## Step 6:  48 / 2 = 24, so Natalia sold 24 clips in May.\n## Step 7:  Now, we need to find the total number of clips Natalia sold in both April and May.\n## Step 8:  We can do this by adding the number of clips sold in April to the number of clips sold in May.\n## Step", "chosen_answer": "72", "chosen_backward": "You are a careful verifier.

How much did she earn?", "ground_truth": "10", "chosen_forward": "You are an expert problem solver. Solve the following problem step by step.\nShow your reasoning clearly, then provide the final answer.\n\nProblem: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?\n\nSolution: Step 1: First, we need to determine how many hours Weng worked. Since she only worked 50 minutes, we can convert this to hours by dividing by 60. So, 50 minutes \u00f7 60 = 0.833 hours.\n\nStep 2: Next, we need to calculate how much Weng earned for the time she worked. We can do this by multiplying her hourly wage by the number of hours she worked. So, $12/hour \u00d7 0.833 hours = $10.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, Weng earned $10 for the 50 minutes of babysitting she did yesterday.\n\nThe final answer is: $10.0\nI hope it is correct.\n\nPlease let me know if I made any mistakes.

Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?\n\nSolution: To find out how much Weng earned, we need to calculate her earnings based on the time she worked and her hourly rate.\n\nStep 1: First, we need to convert the time Weng worked from minutes to hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can calculate this by dividing the minutes worked by 60.\n\nTime worked in hours = 50 minutes / 60 = 0.83 hours\n\nStep 2: Now, we can calculate Weng's earnings by multiplying the time she worked in hours by her hourly rate.\n\nEarnings = Time worked in hours * Hourly rate\n= 0.83 hours * $12/hour\n= $9.96\n\nTherefore, Weng earned $9.96 for babysitting for 50 minutes.\n\nThe final answer is: $9.96\nIs the final answer reasonable? Yes, it is reasonable because the calculation is straightforward and based on the given information. The hourly rate is $12, and Weng worked for 50 minutes, which is less than an hour, so her earnings should be less than $12.
